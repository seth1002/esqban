MPEG Layer 3 (and 2 and 1, and MPEG 2) decoder for Cool Edit
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the code from "maplay" version 1.2.  See mp3.c for more details.
If you used our other MPEG  filters (MPE.FLT and MPG.FLT) you should
remove MPG.FLT and use this decoder (MP3.FLT) instead.
